<p>Bright Star
Bright Star,would l were steadfast ass thou art
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night
And Watching,with eternal lids apart,
Like nature’s patient,sleepless Eremite,
The moving waters at their priest like task
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores,
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors
No-yet still steadfast,still unchangeable,
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, 
Awake forever in a sweet unrest,
Still,still to hear her tender-taken breath,
And so live ever----or else swoon to death
