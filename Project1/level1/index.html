<p>Bright Star<br>
Bright Star<br>would l were steadfast ass thou art<br>
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night<br>
And Watching,with eternal lids apart,<br>
Like nature’s patient,sleepless Eremite,<br>
The moving waters at their priest like task<br>
Of pure ablution round earth’s human shores,<br>
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask<br>
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors<br>
No-yet still steadfast,still unchangeable,<br>
Pillow’d upon my fair love’s ripening breast,<br>
To feel for ever its soft fall and swell, <br>
Awake forever in a sweet unrest,<br>
Still,still to hear her tender-taken breath,<br>
And so live ever----or else swoon to death<br>
John-keats</p>
