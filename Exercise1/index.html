     <h2>Method 1 of 3: Using Your Hand and Armpit</h2>

      <p> <strong>1.Make sure your hands are clean.</strong> They should be dry as well, with no hand cream or moisturizer.
        </p>
       
        

        <img src="images\2.jpg" />
        <p><strong>2.Cup your hand to the opposite arm's armpit.</strong> Use your dominant hand. Your fingers should be between your arm <br>and chest, and your thumb should be on the outside, pointing up.
        </p>
        
        <ul type="circle">
          <li>If you want to do this with a shirt on, the easiest way is with a button down shirt. Just undo one of the buttons a <br>few down from the collar, so that your can stick your hand through the opening in the shirt.</li>
        </ul>
      
        <img src="images\3.jpg">
        
        <p>
          <strong>3.Make a tight seal. </strong>Press your hand firmly into your armpit. There should be as tight of a seal as possible between y<br>our hand and your armpit.
          </p>
        <img src="images\4.jpg">
        
        <p>
          <strong>4.Bend your arm. </strong>Rotate your shoulder downward, the shoulder of the armpit your hand is in. Do this quickly, while<br> maintaining the tight seal by pressing upward with your hand.
          </p>
          <ul>
          <li>You don't have to move your arm much for this to work. It should be a small movement, starting with your upper <br>arm near your side and your forearm across your chest.
</li>
        </ul>
        <img src="images\5.jpg">
        <p><strong>5.Practice.</strong>You probably won't be able to consistently make a realistic farting noise with this technique at first. With p<br>ractice you'll find the perfect speed and positioning.
      </ol>

      <h2>Method 2 of 3: Making a Fart With Your Hands</h2>
      
      <ol class="custom-counter">
        <img src="images\6.jpg"><p>
        <strong>1.Lay your non-dominant hand flat with your palm facing upwards. </strong>Keep your elbow at your side. Your fingers sho<br>uld be pointing at an angle, outwards and towards the opposite hand's direction.</p>

        <img src="images\7.jpg"><p>
        <strong>2.Put your dominant hand on your other hand. </strong>Take your dominant hand and place the palm on the palm of your n<br>on-dominant hand. You want the thumb of your non-dominant hand to line up with second finger joints of your dom<br>inant hand. The edge of your dominant hand's palm should stick out a little.</p>

        <img src="images\8.jpg"><p>
        <strong>3.Wrap your fingers around your hands. </strong>Both your hands' fingers should wrap firmly around your hands.</p>
        
        <img src="images\9.jpg"><p>
       <strong>4.Rotate your hands slightly. </strong>Right now your hands are perpendicular with each other. You need to rotate your dom<br>inant hand upwards slightly.</p>

        <img src="images\10.jpg"><p>
        <strong>5.Smash your palms together. </strong>Move your palms in and out so that the space between them opens and closes. You'll<br> need to practice this and fine tune the movement and speed to get the best realistic fart noise.</p>

      <h2>Method 3 of 3: Using a Straw in Your Armpit</h2>


        <img src="images\11.jpg">
       <p>
        <strong>1.Find a straw. </strong>Bendy straw work the best, but you can try it with a normal straw as well. It just needs to be long enou<br>gh to reach from your armpit to your mouth.</p>

        
      <img src="images\12.jpg">
      
      <p><strong>2.Put the straw in your armpit. </strong>Take one end of the straw and close your armpit around it.</p>
      <ul type="circle"><li>You can do this with a shirt on if you stick it in through the collar.</li>
      </ul>

        <img src="images\13.jpg">
        
     <p>
        <strong>3.Blow to make fart noises. </strong>Put the other end of the straw in your mouth and blow. It should produce realistic sound<br>ing fart noises with ease.</p>
